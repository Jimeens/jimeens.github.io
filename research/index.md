# Research

Here you can find a bit more about my research interests and projects. This includes both themes I've actually worked or have been working on and some themes that draw my attention. 

This page is in construction, and hence things might still be a bit messy around here. 

# Categories: Abstract Algebra

Categories are a fundamental concept in mathematics that allow us to study the properties and relationships between different mathematical objects. They consist of a collection of objects and arrows (also known as morphisms) that connect these objects. Categories provide a powerful tool for understanding abstract mathematical structures, as well as relationships between these structures. In addition, categories can be used to represent a wide range of mathematical concepts, including groups, rings, and topological spaces, among others.

One of the most important aspects of categories is the concept of a functor. A functor is a map between categories that preserves the structure of the categories. Functors can be used to study the relationships between different mathematical structures, as well as the properties of these structures. In addition, functors can be used to transform one category into another, which can be a powerful tool for simplifying mathematical structures and relationships.

The concept of a category has many applications in mathematics, as well as in other fields, such as physics and computer science. In physics, categories have been used to study quantum mechanics, general relativity, and other areas of physics. In computer science, categories have been used to study the structure of programming languages, as well as the relationships between different types of data structures. Overall, the concept of a category provides a powerful and versatile tool for understanding and analyzing a wide range of mathematical and non-mathematical structures and relationships.
