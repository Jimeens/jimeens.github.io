# Categories: Abstract Algebra

Categories are a powerful tool in mathematics that allow us to study the relationships between mathematical objects and their structures in an abstract way. In simple terms, a category is composed of objects and arrows (or morphisms) that connect these objects.

Objects are the basic entities of a category, while arrows represent the relationships between them. These arrows can be commutative or non-commutative, which means they can be inverted or not.

There are some important properties that a category must satisfy. A category must have an identity for each object, and arrow composition must be associative. Additionally, a category can be viewed as a directed graph without cycles.

Categories are useful for studying many different areas of mathematics, such as algebra, topology, and geometry. They provide an elegant way of describing abstract mathematical structures and relationships between them. In the study of categories, it is also common to explore concepts such as functors, products and coproducts, limits and colimits, among many others. These concepts allow the properties of one category to be preserved when mapped to another category. This concept can be applied in Physics too through Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity and Particle Physics.

Overall, the study of categories is an important part of abstract algebra and mathematics in general. It offers a powerful way of understanding mathematical structure and relationships between objects in an abstract way.
