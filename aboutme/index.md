I'm a physics undergraduate student at [Institute of Physics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/) (IFUSP), currently in my final year of graduation. I have a strong interest in mathematical physics, with a specific focus on quantum field theory and general relativity. I have skills in LaTeX, Python, and Photoshop, and speak English at an intermediate level and have basic knowledge of German. I'm excited to contribute to the scientific community through my research and academic work.
