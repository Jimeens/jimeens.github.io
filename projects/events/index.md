## [Summer Mini-course of 2023 at IFUSP](http://portal.if.usp.br/pesquisa/pt-br/node/2234)

During the summer break, from February 6th, 2023 to February 10th, 2023, a summer mini-course with several interesting lectures on physics areas ranging from the quantum structure of matter to cosmology was scheduled. In addition to the lectures, 6 workshops/mini-courses on specific topics were proposed. My choice was the course *Path Integrals: from quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics*, taught by Ph.D. Eric Andrade.
