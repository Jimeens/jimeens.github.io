Here I will be sharing my solutions for the homework assignments I had in my [*Quantum Field Theory*](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=4305107) course, taught by Ph.D. Gustavo Alberto Burdman at the University of São Paulo’s [*Institute of Physics*](https://portal.if.usp.br/) (IFUSP) during the first semester of 2023. In this course, the professor Burdman provides all his class notes in [*Quantum Field Theory I - 1st semester 2023*](http://fma.if.usp.br/~burdman/QFT1/qft1index.html). I consider this notes very good to follow the course, and as a complementary resources, I used Peskin & Schröder, Sredninki, Schwarz, and other books which I think are good books to study QFT. Personally, I consider it to be one of the best courses I have taken in my undergraduate studies for a few very clear reasons:
1. Professor Burdman is a member of the [*Department of Mathematical Physics at IFUSP*](http://portal.if.usp.br/fma/), and has been teaching the course for several years;
2. The course is a graduate course, so the subjects covered are more complex and "current" , which is very motivating for those who are studying;
3. All classes are in English, which motivates me to learn more this lenguage and get even more accustomed to one of the most used languages in physics;
4. The evaluation method is exclusively by lists and an oral test, so the problems assigned are much more interesting than a possible question from a 2h exam, and the oral test is one of the most used methods in universities outside Brazil.

## [Quantum Mechanics II](https://jimeens.github.io/mynotes/Quantum%20Mechanics%20II.pdf)

This is my lecture notes for the course of [*Quantum Mechanics II*](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=4302404), which I am taking with Ph.D. Alexandre A. do Passo Suaide at the University of São Paulo's [*Institute of Physics*](https://portal.if.usp.br/) (IFUSP) during the first semester of 2023. These notes are a combination of my lecture notes, supplemented with additional material from various sources, such as extra bibliography, and revised notation and constants as needed. These lecture notes are a continuation of [*Quantum Mechanics I*](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=4302403), so the intention is still to publish a book with both of them combined. Note that this one is still in development.

## Fluid Mechanics

On this part, I will be sharing my exercise solutions for the homework assignments I had in my [*Fluid Mechanics*](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=4300324) course, taught by Ph.D. Frédérique Marie Brigitte Sylvie Grassi at the University of São Paulo’s [*Institute of Physics*](https://portal.if.usp.br/) (IFUSP) during the first semester of 2023. Since Professor Grassi has personal notes that I found helpful throughout the semester, I did not take additional lecture notes for this course.

## Fundamentals of Chemistry for Physics

Here, I will be sharing my solutions for the study guides assignments I had in my [*Fundamentals of Chemistry for Physics*](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=QFL0606) course, taught by Ph.D. Gianluca Camillo Azzellini at the University of São Paulo’s [*Institute of Chemistry*](https://www.iq.usp.br/portaliqusp/) (IQUSP) during the first semester of 2023. This course is a really useless course which I have learned nothing... all the people I know agree on this.

## [Quantum Mechanics I](https://jimeens.github.io/mynotes/Quantum%20Mechanics%20I.pdf)

This is my lecture notes for the course of [*Quantum Mechanics I*](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=4302403), which I am taking with Ph.D. Alexandre A. do Passo Suaide at the University of São Paulo's [*Institute of Physics*](https://portal.if.usp.br/) (IFUSP) during the second semester of 2022. These notes are a combination of my lecture notes, supplemented with additional material from various sources, such as extra bibliography, and revised notation and constants as needed. My intention (with my friend Felipe Gimenez Souza) is to transform these notes into a comprehensive book on quantum mechanics for undergraduate students who want to explore this beautiful theory. The text was written in Portuguese.
