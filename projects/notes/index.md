# Lecture Notes

Here you can find a collection of my study documents, including lecture notes I've written for courses, study notebooks, and some exercise solutions. Some are in English and some in Portuguese, with titles hyperlinked to corresponding PDF files.

## [Quantum Mechanics I](https://jimeens.github.io/mynotes/Quantum%20Mechanics%20I.pdf)

This is my lecture notes for the course of [*Quantum Mechanics I*](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=4302403), which I am taking with Ph.D. Alexandre A. do Passo Suaide at the University of São Paulo's [*Institute of Physics*](https://portal.if.usp.br/) (IFUSP) during the second semester of 2022. These notes are a combination of my lecture notes, supplemented with additional material from various sources, such as extra bibliography, and revised notation and constants as needed. My intention (with my friend Felipe Gimenez Souza) is to transform these notes into a comprehensive book on quantum mechanics for undergraduate students who want to explore this beautiful theory. The text was written in Portuguese.

## Fluid Mechanics

Here I will post all of my exercise solutions for homeworks that I had in my course of [*Fluid Mechanics*](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=4300324), taught by Ph.D. Frédérique Marie Brigitte Sylvie Grassi at the University of São Paulo's [*Institute of Physics*](https://portal.if.usp.br/) (IFUSP) during the first semester of 2023. I don't make lecture notes to this course because the professor Grassi have personal notes which I liked during the throughout the semester.
