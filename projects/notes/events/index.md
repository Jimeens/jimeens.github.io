# Events

Here you may find a few of the events I've helped organized or have been working on throughout my years in Physics. Most of these (actually, while I'm writing this, all of them) are in Portuguese and some are in English (not really). I chose to leave the descriptions in agreement with the project's language. Notice some titles are hyperlinks to the events' websites. Notice also that, unfortunately, some of the websites were hosted on a server I no longer have access to, and hence there might be a few dead links around here.
